Coinnect is a Rust library aiming to provide a complete access to REST APIs for
various crypto-currencies exchanges (see below for a list of supported
exchanges).
All methods consume HTTPS api. The purpose of this crate is not to stream data
(you should use websocket/FIX in that case).

You basically have 2 choices to retrieve data : use the raw API provided by the
platform you target or use the generic Coinnect API, which is more user-friendly
and safe. Ideally, use the raw API when the Coinnect API could not retrieve the
data/perform the action you want.

**WARNING:**  This library is highly experimental at the moment. Please do not
invest what you can't afford to lose. This is a personal project, I cannot be
held responsible for the library malfunction, which can lead to a loss of money.

### Exchanges support:
| Exchange | Raw API supported | Generic API supported | Note |
|:--------:|:-----------------:|:---------------------:|:----:|
| Bitstamp | X | X | Not every method is implemented for now.|
| Kraken   | X | X | - |
| Poloniex | X | X | - |
| Bittrex  | X | X | - |

Generic API supports:
 - Ticker
 - Orderbook
 - Balances
 - Add a new order
 - ... more to come!

Feel free to make a PR to add support to your favorite exchange ;)

### Documentation

- [Master](https://docs.rs/coinnect/)


## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
coinnect = "0.5"
```

and this to your crate root:

```rust
extern crate coinnect;
```

For optional parameters, most methods require an empty `str` (`""`) or
`Option` (`None`) if you don't want to specify them.

Since 0.2, you have access to a generic API to communicate across exchanges in
the same way. Note that this functionality is under active development.
For more informations, look at ExchangeApi trait doc.

## Example

The example below shows you how to connect to Poloniex

```rust
extern crate coinnect;

use coinnect::poloniex::api::PoloniexApi;
use coinnect::poloniex::credentials::PoloniexCreds;

fn main() {
    // We create a PoloniexApi by providing API key/secret
    // You can give an empty str if you only use public methods
    let creds = PoloniexCreds::new("my_optionnal_name", "api_key", "api_secret");
    let mut my_api = PoloniexApi::new(creds).unwrap();

    // Let's look at the ticker!
    let list_coins = my_api.return_ticker().unwrap();

    for coin in list_coins {
        // please visit Poloniex API documentation to know how the data is returned
        // or look at the coinnect documentation
        let name = coin.0;
        let price = coin.1.as_object().unwrap().get("last").unwrap().as_str().unwrap();

        println!("Coin {} has price : {}", name, price);
    }
}

```

For more examples, please see [examples](examples/).

## Testing
You can run the tests suite with `cargo test` for testing non private data
requests (this will ignore tests related to private requests).
You can use `cargo test --features "bitstamp_private_tests"` to run private
tests related to bitstamp exchange for example.
Before running private tests, make sure you have a `keys_real.json` file at the
root with the following structure :
```json
{
    "account_kraken": {
        "api_key"   : "123456789ABCDEF",
        "api_secret": "ABC&EF?abcdef"
    },
    "account_poloniex": {
        "api_key"   : "XYXY-XYXY-XYXY-XY",
        "api_secret": "A0A0B1B1C2C2"
    },
    "account_bitstamp": {
        "api_key"    : "XYXY-XYXY-XYXY-XY",
        "api_secret" : "A0A0B1B1C2C2",
        "customer_id": "123456"
    }
}
```
You must insert your real API keys, otherwise private tests may fail. No
action is performed if you run the tests : no test will open position, or
withdraw, etc.
Tests only check for correct authentication method and correct parsing.
You can examine the [tests](tests) folder just to be sure and look at the
[Cargo.toml](Cargo.toml) file for a complete list of features.
